## üîå Wiring Diagram

![Wiring Diagram](hardware/wiring.png)

<!-- TODO: Crear y agregar diagrama de conexiones -->

**Important Notes:**
- Use appropriate pull-up/pull-down resistors
- Ensure proper voltage levels (3.3V vs 5V)
- Add filtering capacitors near sensors to reduce noise
- <!-- TODO: Otras notas importantes de conexi√≥n -->

## üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printed Parts

All STL files are available in the [`hardware/3d_models/`](hardware/3d_models/) directory.

**Organization:** Each sensor has its own folder containing:
- STL files for printing
- `img/` subfolder with assembly reference images

This structure helps you see how each component should look when assembled and mounted.

### Parts List

- Main housing/enclosure
- Sensor mounts
- Radiation shield (Stevenson screen style for temperature accuracy)
- **Rain gauge** - Complete tipping bucket mechanism
- **Anemometer** (optional, budget alternative to HOBO sensor)
  - Cup assembly
  - Bearing mount
  - Pulse generator mechanism
- Mounting brackets
- Cable management clips

### Print Settings

- **Layer Height:** 0.2mm
- **Infill:** 20-30%
- **Material:** PETG or ASA (UV and weather resistant)
  - **Critical:** Do NOT use PLA - it degrades quickly outdoors
- **Supports:** Required for overhangs in rain gauge and anemometer parts
- **Post-processing:** 
  - Seal layer lines with epoxy or UV-resistant coating
  - Sand parts that contact moving components (rain gauge, anemometer)
  
### Assembly Notes

- Use stainless steel hardware for outdoor durability
- Apply thread locker on outdoor fasteners
- Ensure proper ventilation in temperature sensor housing
- Test rain gauge calibration after assembly (0.375mm per tip)

## üì• Installation

### 1. Hardware Assembly

1. Print all 3D parts
2. Solder components according to wiring diagram
3. Assemble weather station housing
4. Mount sensors in appropriate locations
5. Connect ESP32 to power supply

<!-- TODO: Expandir con pasos m√°s detallados -->

### 2. ESPHome Setup

#### Prerequisites

- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) installed
- Home Assistant running (optional but recommended)
- USB cable for initial flash

#### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weather-station-esp32.git
cd weather-station-esp32
```

2. Copy the secrets template:
```bash
cp secrets.yaml.example secrets.yaml
```

3. Edit `secrets.yaml` with your credentials:
```yaml
wifi_ssid: "Your_WiFi_SSID"
wifi_password: "Your_WiFi_Password"
# ... etc
```

4. Adjust `weather_station.yaml` settings:
   - Static IP address (or comment out for DHCP)
   - Device name
   - Calibration values (see [Calibration](#calibration) section)

5. Compile and upload:
```bash
esphome run weather_station.yaml
```

6. After first flash, use OTA updates for future changes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Static IP vs DHCP

By default, the configuration uses a static IP. To use DHCP instead, comment out the `manual_ip` section:

```yaml
wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password
  # manual_ip:
  #   static_ip: 192.168.1.XXX
  #   ...
```

### Update Intervals

Adjust sensor update intervals based on your needs:
- Battery monitoring: 10 minutes (default)
- Temperature/Humidity: 15 minutes (default)
- Wind/Rain: 60 seconds (real-time)

Lower intervals = more frequent updates but higher power consumption.

### MQTT (Optional)

To enable MQTT, uncomment the MQTT section in `weather_station.yaml` and add credentials to `secrets.yaml`.

## üéØ Calibration

### Soil Moisture Sensor

**Important:** Calibration is sensor-specific and critical for accuracy.

#### For Decagon 10HS (Current configuration):
- Dry (in air): 0.40V = 0%
- Wet (in water): 1.12V = 100%

#### For Sonoff MS01 (Budget alternative):
Calibration values will differ. To calibrate:

1. Place sensor in air (completely dry) and note voltage
2. Place sensor in water (completely saturated) and note voltage
3. Update in YAML:
```yaml
- calibrate_linear:
    - YOUR_DRY_VOLTAGE -> 0
    - YOUR_WET_VOLTAGE -> 100
```

**To check voltage readings:**
```bash
esphome logs weather_station.yaml
```

### Wind Speed (Anemometer)

#### HOBO S-WSB-M003 (recommended):
- Current calibration: 0.0111156 √ó 3.6 (converts to km/h)
- Professional-grade sensor with proven accuracy

#### 3D Printed Alternative (budget option):
- Requires calibration against known wind speed or reference anemometer
- Factor may vary based on cup size and bearing friction
- Start with same calibration factor and adjust based on testing

**Calibration process:**
1. Compare readings with local weather station
2. Adjust multiplier factor in YAML if needed

### Rain Gauge (3D Printed)

- **Current calibration:** 0.375mm per tip
- **Type:** Tipping bucket with pulse counter
- Design based on standard rain gauge geometry

**To verify calibration:**
1. Pour a known volume of water (e.g., 10ml)
2. Count the number of tips
3. Calculate: mm of rain = volume (ml) / collection area (cm¬≤)
4. Adjust multiplier in YAML if needed

**Note:** The 3D printed design STL includes the collection funnel with specific diameter for 0.375mm/tip calibration.

### Battery Monitor

Voltage divider ratio: 7.3037037

**To calibrate:**
1. Measure actual battery voltage with multimeter
2. Compare with sensor reading
3. Adjust multiplier: `new_multiplier = (actual_voltage / sensor_reading) * current_multiplier`

## üè† Home Assistant Integration

### Automatic Discovery

Once ESPHome device is running, it will automatically appear in Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
2. ESPHome integration should show your weather station
3. Click **Configure** and enter API encryption key

### Creating Dashboards

Example Lovelace card configuration:

```
type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: tile
    entity: sensor.temperatura
    vertical: false
    color: teal
    features_position: bottom
    name: Temperatura
    show_entity_picture: true
  - type: tile
    entity: sensor.humedad
    vertical: false
    color: orange
    features_position: bottom
    name: Humedad
    show_entity_picture: true

```

### Automations

Example automation for irrigation based on soil moisture:

```
   alias: Riego jard√≠n ON
description: Encendido de riego diario
triggers:
  - at: "19:00:00"
    trigger: time
  - at: "06:00:00"
    trigger: time
conditions:
  - condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.humsuelo_3
    below: 50
actions:
  - action: switch.turn_on
    metadata: {}
    data: {}
    target:
      entity_id: switch.riego_jardin
  - data:
      message: Encendido programado.
      title: "Sistema de riego:"
    action: notify.mobile_app_1
  - data:
      message: Encendido programado.
      title: "Sistema de riego:"
    action: notify.mobile_app_2
mode: single

```
